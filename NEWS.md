# libbib 1.6

## new features

1. Wrote a translation layer to translate more human-readable aliases
   of every WorldCat SRU search index to their formal name. The
   `worldcat_api_search` function now uses this by default. You can still use
   the formal names, and even mix codes in the same query. The function
   documentation has been updated to reflect these new aliases.

2. A vignette on how to use the WorldCat search API is now available
   with a ton of very useful information.

3. Added `dt_na_breakdown` function.

4. Added detailed vignette on using the `worldcat_api_search` function

## bug fixes
1. `print.progress` conditional now works for Location and Search API functions

2. Fixed a bug where if the number of search results was an exact multiple
   of 100, the search api function wouldn't return anything


## improvements

1. WorldCat API functions will now error if no WSKEY is provided
   (either with `options("libbib.wskey"=...)` or explicitly
   in the formal parameters

2. WorldCat Search function now tolerant of newlines and multiple
   spaces. Now long queries can be look neat

3. More of the diagnostic output now uses `message` instead of `print` or `cat`

4. If no Search API results are returned, the function prints the any
   diagnostic message returned from the Search API
   (things like Query syntax operators and unsupported indexes)

5. `get_clean_names` and `dt_set_clean_names` will now never produce
   duplicate column names

6. `dt_keep_cols` will warn user if a supplied column name doesn't
   exist in the supplied data.table

7. `dt_add_to_col_names` will, by default, error if any of the new
   names create any duplicate column names (not setting the new
   names). If `TRUE`, all the column names are made unique,
   potentially renaming excluded column names that were not supposed
   to be changed.

8. Added option in `dt_counts_and_percents` (and `dt_na_breakdown`)
   to specify a `big.mark` which will be used to separate every
   three digits of the count. If `FALSE` (the default) the count
   will remain and integer.

## small breaking changes

1. `marc_008_get_info` no longer returns the original publication
   date by default

2. excluding "questionable dates" in `marc_008_get_info` just NAs
   character position 6="q", now

3. The `print.api.responses` parameter in the Classify API functions has
   been changed to `debug` to be more consistent with the other API functions.

4. `num_total` column in search results has been renamed the (more descriptive)
   `total_wc_results`

5. By default, `get_clean_names` and `dt_set_clean_names` will convert
   all upper case characters to lower case. This can be overidden with
   by setting the `lower` parameter (in both) to `FALSE`.

7. Added functions to use the WorldCat Bib Read API,
   read/parse the returned MARCXml, and return a `data.table`
   containing the most pertinent information.

8. Added functions to use the WorldCat Classify API and return a
   `data.table` containing the most popular Dewey and LC call numbers.

## improvements
